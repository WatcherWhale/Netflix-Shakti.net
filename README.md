# Netflix-Shakti.net
An unofficial .net wrapper for the not so public Netflix Shakti API.
It uses asynchronous methods to obtain information from the Shakti api.

## Practical Information
**Go to the [wiki](https://github.com/WatcherWhale/Netflix-Shakti.net/wiki) pages**

**Download from NuGet**
```
PM> Install-Package NetflixShakti.net
```

## Want to help
The whole Shakti api is not really discovered you can help out by figuring out the Shakti api and document it and sending it to me. You can also make an example how the api can be used in c# (easier for me) or you can just straight up fork the project and send me your changes.

## License
The Shakti.net api falls under the MIT license.
